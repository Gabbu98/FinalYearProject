Design and evaluation of a prototype of augmented reality applied to
medical devices
-"Even though use of medical devices is extremely beneficial for patient care, potential problems associated with their use may produce
severe, negative consequences, compromising patient safety."

-"medical device manufacturers
are obliged by Spanish legislation for each device to include “the necessary information to use it completely safely and properly, considering potential users’ training and knowledge, and to identify the
manufacturer”"

-"Participation from the research team, as future users, led to
a participatory design involving users in the design of the device [22].

General Requirements for Industrial Augmented Reality Applications
-" Although Augmented Reality applications have been used
successfully in medical or military contexts for many years, industrial applications are often perceived as isolated solutions that are only applicable
in a defined and static work environment."

-" Although the integration of individual workpieces is a strongly desired feature, it requires considerable development effort, which leads to additional
costs and cannot be performed instantly."
